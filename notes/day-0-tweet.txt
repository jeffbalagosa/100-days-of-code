This is officially day 0 of the first round of my 100 days of code challenge. I'm currently using this post as an accountability tool to let everyone know that I am taking on this challenge, starting tomorrow. The 100 Days of Code challenge is committing toâ€¦ Code for at least an hour every day, while tweeting about it to hold yourself accountable.
