# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 92: July 5, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Completed _Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests_ module.
  - Finished the _Film Finder_ project.
  - Finished the _Introduction to Web Security_ lessons and exercises.
  - Finshed _Review: Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests_.
- Started _Web Apps_ Module.
  - Completed _Introduction: Web Apps lesson_.

### Thoughts

- Breezed through web security. Most of the concepts I'm already familiar with because of work.
- Excited to finally start Web Apps. React/Redux is just around the corner from here. Once I'm done with those, I can pick up my portfolio again and finalize some stuff in it.

## Day 91: July 4, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Film Finder_ project.

### Thoughts

- I'm grateful that I'm already in the technology field. A common problem with these courses is that some parts quickly become outdated, if they depend on 3rd party apps to complete.
  - For example, I used my FB profile to sign up to this site got get my API key. FB must have changed their terms and now the tests we need to do in the console for this project throw errors. Even though the app actuall still works. I was able to troubleshoot past those, but I'm not sure others taking this course would be able to.
- Also, still no response to my forum post. Lol!

## Day 90: July 3, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished both _Requests with Fetch API_ lessons. (Didn't realize there were two.)
- Started working on the _Film Finder_ project.

### Thoughts

- I'm actually diggin' this project! It's a randomized movie suggestion app by genre, that uses an api from The Movie Database. Once you're done, you have the option of expanding the app to include TV show recommendations. I'm pretty sure I'll want to do that. I love any apps that can help me make decisions without needing to expend my executive function energy.
- Also still, no one has responded to my forum post...

## Day 89: July 2, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Almost done with the _Request with Fetch API_ lesson and exercises.
  -There were a lot in of lessons within that lesson, but it was well structured. It walked us how to generate and use APIs for simple stuff like url shortening. They also showed how to chain .then methods error handling within.

### Thoughts

- No one has responded to my forum post... Kinda bummed.
- On an unrelated note, Jordan B. Peterson got banned from Twitter and is standing his ground. I support him and I think people who don't, misunderstand his point. I really dislike _woke_ Twitter as a platform and business. Once this challenge is over, I'm considering abandoning it to do other challenges on different platforms.
- But I'm just ranting now... Have a great day everyone! See you tomorrow.

## Day 88: July 1, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _APIs and HTTP Requests_ module.
- Started the _Learn JavaScript Syntax: Reqeusts_ module.
  - Working through the _Request with Fetch API_ lesson and exercises.

### Thoughts

- Came accross a code challenge in the _APIs and HTTP Requests_ module that marked me incorrect, even though my solution matched the sites solution.
  - I really couldn't let that fly! It bothered me that much. So I wrote up a forum post about it. Was I wasting my time. Possibly... Do I feel good about my post. Meh... Lol!

## Day 87: June 30, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished all the lessons and exercises in the _Learn JavaSript Syntax: Async-Await_ lesson.
- Now going over APIs, REST, and JSON.

### Thoughts

- Finally getting to work with APIs. Been hearing about them and have worked with stuff that includes API requests at work, but I never really got to understand them.

## Day 86: June 29, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Learn JavaScript Syntax: Promises_ lesson.
  - Got 90% on the quiz, but it took me 2 tries.
- Working through _Learn JavaSript Syntax: Async-Await_
  - Currently going through exercises for using try and catch inside of async functions.

### Thoughts

- As I thought, my understanding of _Promises_ in JavaScript wasn't strong. But it was strong enough to sort of understand the quiz. My first score was 60%, but second was 90%. I think I got the better score, just off memorization.
- Working through the async functions, I'm starting to understand these functions more. But figuring out when and where to implement them in a real project, without any guidance, will be tough.
- I watched a video of a guy talking about how many hours you should be putting into your study of coding. He mentioned at minimum 15 hours per week total. And you should be touching code every day. In "The Clean Coder" by Uncle Bob, he states 20 hours per week. He states that you should always be studying, no matter where you are in your career. Shit! How do these guys have time for friends & family? Health & fitness? Or just things you need to do to be a well rounded human being?
- Well, I knew going into this, that it won't be easy. So I'll find a way to keep up with my good habits and responsibilities, while consistenly pursuing excellence in this craft.

## Day 85: June 28, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Introduction: Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests_ lesson.
- Finished Basics of _Asynchronous JavaScript_ lesson.
- Working through _Learn JavaScript Syntax: Promises_ lesson.

### Thoughts

- Breezing through these so quickly, I'm afraid when it comes to implementation, I may not have it all down.
  - Quiz tomorrow, so we'll see if that's true or not.

## Day 84: June 27, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Factorial Feature_ project.
- Started working through Async JavaScript and HTTP requests.

### Thoughts

- The _Factorial Feature_ was pretty easy in comparison to the JavaScript III project.

## Day 83: June 26, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Completed lessons and exercises within the TDD module.
- Completed TDD module quize and got 100% on the first try.
- Started _Factorial Feature_ project.

### Thoughts

- I wish I had started TDD with my very first project. It would've saved a lot of headache and made coding much more fun.
- Not sure if others feel the same way about TDD, but it really is like gamifying your coding process.
- Also, realized that I wasn't updating the date for each log since Tuesday. Sorry about that. I need to be paying more attention.

## Day 82: June 25, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Started and finished _Rooster Regulation_ challenge project.
- Started learning the TDD philosophy.

### Thoughts

- Writing and executing unit tests are legit fun! As I thought they'd be!
  - Most people in technology are gamers. The attractive aspect of gaming is the constant feedback loop a video game provides. Try a solution, the solution fails right away, try another solution it also fails right away, try another and... Success! It's addictive. TDD can be seen in this frame too.

## Day 81: June 24, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on _JavaScript Testing_ module.
  - Got 91% on quiz, on the first attempt.

### Thoughts

- Went through a bunch of the different assert methods available in node. Like assert.strictEqual(), assert.ok(), and assert.deepEqual(). Spoiler: Last one is used for objects, and uses loose equal (==).

## Day 80: June 23, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on _JavaScript Testing_ module.

### Thoughts

- While it does seem like a lot of overhead work. Writing tests in Mocha does seem like you'll be less error prone. If the functions are easy, I may be tempted not to use it, but getting into the habit will be important. Goot testing covers 100% of the codebase, or as close to 100% as possible.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on _JavaScript Testing_ module.
  - Took the first quiz.
  - Started using Mocha to write tests.

### Thoughts

- Got 100% on the first quize on the first try!
- Finally writing tests. I can already see how I could start using this for my projects.

## Day 78: June 21, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
- Started working on _JavaScript Testing_ module.

### Thoughts

- Finally done with that stupid project!
- Now getting into something I've wanted to learn for a while now. TDD!

## Day 77: June 20, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
  - Continued working on movement and validating win/loss conditions.
  - Further along than yesterday.

### Thoughts

- I feel like I'm close to finishing this one. It feels a little cheap. I had to go through completed projects to find some inspiration. Basically using the Stack Overflow/Rubber duck debugging approach. Needed to change a lot of my code to make sure things I found useful could work. But it's a good sign that I understand it.

## Day 76: June 19, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
  - Still worked on moving the player and showing movement.
  - Worked on creating validation functions for declaring win, declaring loss, or advancing the player.

### Thoughts

- Another rough day today. This is the 3rd Father's day since my Dad passed in 2019. My dad duel engineered in the electrical and mechanical fields. He was one of the smartest men I ever knew. I idolized him for it. In a way, my goal for becoming a software engineer is in his honor.

## Day 75: June 18, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
  - Mainly worked on moving the player and showing movement.

### Thoughts

- After a couple hours of struggle, I finally figured out how to move the player's character. It was the wrong way. But it didn't error out or show no movement at all. That's progress in my book!

## Day 74: June 17, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
  - Experimented with different ways of locating and moving player.

### Thoughts

- Got stuck trying to figure out how to show the current index of the player's position in a multidimensional array.
  - Apparently .indexof method falls apart here, because the strict === usage. [0, 1] ==== [0, 1] turns out to be false. I can't find a satisfying answer as to why this is the case. But most answers I find online will use a for or while loop to traverse array and find it, or flatten the array.
- Figured I was spending too much time on getting the player's current positon to display as an array. I don't think I really need it for this project. So I decided to move onto movement of the \*.

## Day 73: June 16, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
  - Built functionality to capture user input to move character.
  - Added functionality of getting the current player's location.

### Thoughts

- Not stuck yet. And I'm further along than last time. So that's good. However, there's still a lot more to do.

## Day 72: June 15, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished all 3 _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.
- Restarted the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_.
  - Build the first constructor for the field class.
  - Built the first .print method required.

### Thoughts

- Silly me thinking I actually solved the first part of the 3rd problem yesterday. The if statement I used to "wrap" code wasn't doing what I thought it was doing. The second test kept failing miserably becuase it had values out of bounds.
- However, I was eventually able to figure it out by stepping a little bit away from the problem. I used 2 while loops instead. And that shit actually worked! First and second tests passed.
- Now onto the _Find Your Hat Challenge Project_. This was the one that kicked my ass last time and caused me to restart the whole classes course. Now I know it's not really my understanding of classes that was screwing me up. It really is a combination of me not understanding the directions and me needing to get better at algorithms. Let's see how I do this time around.

## Day 71: June 14, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished 2.5 of 3 _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.

### Thoughts

- Woah! Major breakthrough! The 3rd challenge was tough and is broken up into two parts. I was able to do the first part by working through it! Without looking at any of the solution. It's crazy but also fun to think that there are even harder challenges out there!

## Day 70: June 12, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished 2 of 3 _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.

### Thoughts

- 2nd challenge was pretty tough still. I had to look at the solution to fix my code.
- I have a feeling that there is something wrong with the test to validate my solution. My solution did all the same things as the Codecademy solution, but the result wasn't the same. Then I copied the solution but rearranged function format (from arrow to standard function), and renamed some variables. It passed that time. Hope that was enough to be able to understand classes they way they want me to.

## Day 69: June 12, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _School Catalogue_ project.
- Re-Started the _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.

### Thoughts

- School Cataloge went by pretty easy. The pickSubstituteTeacher method was easier to create than I had thought yesterday.
- Now for challenges. These were **really difficult** the first time around. Got through the first challenge fairly easy. I didn't remember what I did the first time around, because I looked up the solution after getting fustrated. Didn't need that this time and was able to finish it without it.
- Just started challenge 2 before time ran out.

## Day 68: June 11, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _Build A Library_ project.
- Re-started the _School Catalogue_ project.

### Thoughts

- Figured out what I was missing for the .reduce method. Breezed right through the reset of the _Build A Library_ project.
- Having a bit of trouble with the pickSubstituteTeacher method in the School Catalogue project. Not sure how to initialize an argument as a string. But time ran out before I could try some solutions.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Build A Library_ project.

### Thoughts

- So far, I haven't had to use the video walkthrough. But I am having a hard time with the .reduce method I'm supposed to use for one of the tasks.

## Day 66: June 9, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished material, exercises, and quiz for _JavaScript Syntax, Part III: Classess_.
- Restarted the _Build A Library_ project.

### Thoughts

- All seems easy so far. Even easier than the last because I just went over this. I'm starting to think that maybe the gap in knowledge isn't about classes themselves, but problem solving and understanding the particular tasks of the chanllenge projects that got me before I decided to restart this course. That makes things worse, because ambiguity about instructions are harder to solve when you can't ask the person that wrote the course.

## Day 65: June 8, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Started going back over the _JavaScript Syntax, Part III: Classess_ material and exercises.

### Thoughts

- Like before, the practices amd articles seem pretty straight forward. It's even easier now that I've already gone through them. The problem is that the examples we go over are too simplistic.
- Once you get into the challenges, later in the course, you're required not only to use constructors, but also include some pretty tricky methods within the functions.
  - They call on and edit the properties inside of the constructors in weird ways. The course material says that you aren't supposed to call on **this.\_whatever directly**, but use the getters instead. But then the solutions show otherwise... The inconsistency is maddening!

## Day 64: June 7, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges. (Sort of.)
- Started the _Challenge Project: Find Your Hat_.
- Decided to restart the _JavaScript Syntax, Part III: Classess_ and the _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.

### Thoughts

- I'm having a really tough time with these. Classes seem pretty straight forward when going through the course, but the challenges were very confusing. They were all too difficult for me to complete without looking at the solutions.
- Then I got to the find _Challenge Project: Find Your Hat_. I couldn't even get the constructor properties right.
- Although really discouraging, I had to remind myself, this challenge isn't about finishing. It's about learning. I don't want to just finish the course. I want to be exceptional at the discipline of programming.
- So... Even though it's going to take even more struggle, I'm starting these classes and will restart them over and over until I grasp it. Jiu Jitsu was really confusing for half a decade. If I could struggle through that and make it to black belt. I can struggle through this too...

## Day 63: June 6, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working through _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.

### Thoughts

- Wow these are tough! I know I said the same thing yesterday, but damn! I need more practice with building and using classes. The one I'm on right now wamnts me to build a class that takes a string then you can use the class methods to either encrypt or decript that string. The class encourages you to use these string methods that I've never even heard of. And the MDN explanation of what these methods do have me looking up dictionary terms ever other word.
- I need more practice with them.

## Day 62: June 5, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Pair Programming_ informational.
- Started _JavaScript Practice: Classes_ code challenges.

### Thoughts

- I've read _The Pragmatic Programmer_ by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt and am currently reading _The Clean Coder_ by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob). Both books seem to be highly regarded staples of the industry and both books highly recommend pair programming for writing clean code. Now CodeCademy reccommends it. I'm hoping my first job realizes the value in this practice and implements it.
- The classes code challenges are very difficult.

## Day 61: June 4, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished in-house project: _WorkAround Explorer_

### Thoughts

- The importing and exporting values from modules and the _WorkAround Explorer_ project was very poorly done.
  - I don't expect hand holding, but I do expect some sort of direction given if you are totally lost. This one doesn't have any of that. If you get stuck, it pretty much directs you to the forum.
- Also the entire module is taught in 1 long article. Sure, there are code challenges in the article, but the moment you refresh the page, it resets. So you won't have any notes to go back to if you need them.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished article and code challenges for ES6 _Modules_
- Working through the tasks in the in-house project: _WorkAround Explorer_

### Thoughts

- I'm **very** tired today. Couldn't sleep at all after Jiu Jitsu. I was really just _going through the motions_ to get this hour done. And I'm ok with that.
- My brain just can't absorb the syntax for exporting and importing modules. I read them, then forget them mere minutes later.
- But I made it! Completed month two, baby! Hell yeah!

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _Build A Library_ project.
- Started the _School Catalogue_ project.

### Thoughts

- Starting to get a hang of it. The _this.\_property = property, getters, & setters_ concepts are making more sense to me now. As does the concept of inheritance. Feel better about this project than the previous _Build A Library_ project.

  - Got a 90%, but it took me 2 tries. lol
- Made more Anki flashcards.
- Started working on the _Build A Library_ project.

### Thoughts

- I'm still shaky on classes. I tried to go through each of the project tasks without using any hints or walkthroughs, but found that I was getting stuck a lot.
- There were new concepts that the walkthrough went over that I haven't seen before. Lke using a not operator to toggle between a boolean value.
- I also noticed that I'm also still sketchy when it comes to methods that use call back functions. I need more practice on those.

## Day 56: May 30, 2022, Monday (Memorial Day)

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Got through most of the _JavaScript Classes_ module.
- Made some flash cards for old stuff I should have committed to memory by now. Like how to make a proper getRandomNumber(min, max) number. (Max inclusive and Min inclusive.)

### Thoughts

- Learned about the concepts of Inheritance and extending classes.
  - Learned what _super_ does within an extended class.
  - Learned _static_ methods and how/when they are used.
  - Thought I wasn't getting it because the assignments kept erroring out... But realized it was just a typo. (Overthinking much!?)
- **Happy Memorial Day** everyone! Don't forget to thank our wonderful soldiers in the armed services. They make sacrifices for our country's sake!

## Day 55: May 29, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished CodeCademy's requirements for my _Portfolio Project_
  - All except making it public.
  - That won't happen until it's polished.
- Started working through the _JavaScript Classes_ module.

### Thoughts

- Learning about classes is pretty exciting! There's a lot I thought I knew about classes, which turns out wasn't the case.
  - Up until now, I assumed classes were objects with methods built in. They are actually two different things.
  - Yes they are similar, but there are key differences. Like constructors and the lack of commas between functions.

## Day 54: May 28, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Codecademy _Portfolio Project_
  - Changed the background video to an image, but kept the overlay
  - Had to update the css to make it look as clean as possible.

### Thoughts

- I've pretty much fulfilled all the requirements for the project, except for launching it publicly. I just don't feel like it's ready for that.
  - There's still 2 placehoders where two more projects can go.
  - I'd like a better background image. May have to bite the bullet and buy one.
  - I'd still like to attach a blog with a CMS to the site too.
- I made the difficult decision to remove the video and opt for a background image.
  - The video was super cool but it hogged too much resources.
  - My h1's glow effect is much better now, but my background has a repeat on the verticle axis. I don't like it, it bothers me.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Codecademy _Portfolio Project_
  - Added JavaScript for interactivity.
  - Added JavaScript Chance library to help with randomization.
  - Added click functionality to header.

### Thoughts

- Adding and using the .onclick function was super easy this time around!
- The functionality I added is more of an Easter Egg and pretty rudimentary right now. Will work on getting it better later.

## Day 52: May 26, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished back into _Git & GitHub Part 1_ module.
  - Took quiz.
- "Started" portfolio project.

### Thoughts

- I mis-spoke yesterday about my confidence using git and github.
  - I'm good with using git as an individual.
  - But I'm unfamiliar with the work flow of working within a team.
  - The quiz really showed me that.
  - My Anki flashcards are now filled with stuff I need to remember.
- It's ironic that the section I'm on now is to build a portfolio site. Lol! I'll make sure I meet the project requirements before moving on.
  - The page itself will be completed for the project, but I still want to add 2 projects on there before showing it to potential employers.

## Day 51: May 25, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _CSS Animations_ Module.
- Went back into _Git & GitHub Part 1_ module.
  - Got to skip ahead again.
  - Finished a good chuck of git in the Full Stack course.
  - I also use git, github, & gitlab daily. So I'm pretty familiar with it. And (a little) familiar how to work with a team in git.

### Thoughts

- The advanced animations with using @keyframes really kicked my @$$. Codecademy doesn't really give you much in the way of walkthroughs and code alongs. They present it in more of an _aside_ article with code challenges. I did 2 challenges and decided that I can look the rest up when I need to use it. I have a good grasp of what's possible with them, I can look up syntax to fill in the gaps.
- Learned some new things about git. Totally didn't realize I can combine commands. I'll test the extent of this later. I also learned that you can create your own shorthands for long commands. I'll have to also experiment later.

## Day 50: May 24, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued _CSS Animations_ Module.

### Thoughts

- Going over transitions part was pretty easy, I got a 91% on the quiz on the first try.
- The advanced part using @keyframes was a little more confusing.
  - Codecademy decided to use an article then give coding challenges. The article wasn't really helpful for the coding challenges. Had to google a little and still couldn't find the answers until ran up. My have to query the community later.
- Outside the challenge, I worked a lot on the Pick or Shuffle web app. It's coming along. But the code is messy. Still in more of a _rapid prototype_ phase.

## Day 49: May 23, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _Accessibility Module_.
- Started _CSS animations_ module.

### Thoughts

- The accessibility module took longer than I thought it would. I wonder how this is done in real world application. Sure it's things like aria-label is implemented on big sites like Facebook or The New York Times. But smaller sites like _Vegas.com_ use it? How about _Resorts Stay International_?
- CSS animations will be another review for me. I've learned transitions from other places. But let's see what else I can learn.

## Day 48: May 22, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _Form a Story project_.
- Started the _Accessibility Module_.

### Thoughts

- Late last night I started making a list randomizer/picker web app for the hell of it. I could have easily added that time to this challenge, but decided not to, for the sake of _taking the hard road_. It's my usually M.O. But, I'm considering adding it to my portfolio when I'm done.

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished HTML forms module.
- Almost done with HTML form validation.
  - Got 100% on the quiz, first try!
- Started the _Form a Story project_.
  - About halfway done...

### Thoughts

- Used binaural beats to study again. Could be placebo, but I think it's helping!

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Went over HTML forms.
  - Text inputs.
  - Checkboxes.
  - Radio inputs.
  - Select elements.
  - Datalists.

### Thoughts

- Used binaural beats at 40hz. Focus was much better this time, and even while super tired from Jiu Jitsu last night! Feel free to google _Andrew Huberman 40hz Binaural Beats_, if you're inclined to know more.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the _Piano Keys_ project.
- Went over form validation.
  - ...via html.
  - ...via client side JavaScript.
  - ...via back end database.

### Thoughts

- As promised, I uploaded the project to GitHub and put the link below for your viewing pleasure.
- The last half was easy. It was just mostly copy and paste of previously built statements. I juat had to change HTML IDs and variables values for the tasks asked of me.

## Day 44: May 18, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Continued working on the _Piano Keys_ project.

### Thoughts

- Codecademy offers walkthroughs of some of these projects if you get stuck. This one is no exception. I generally don't have to use them to complete projects. But this one is really kicking my @$$! I've been watching it for every task.
- There's some good that's coming out of it though. Had a small "AHA!" moment on step 12. I finally get what's happening in these event handlers.
  - For some reason, I was thinking that we're just defining these functions after writing down the events. But we're actually doing both calling as well as defining them in the same statment. I don't think I've ever done that, so it was foreign to me.
  - I'll try downloading the code and post it on my git later so ya'll can see what I'm talking about.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Got through all the articles and exercises for event handlers.
- Took quiz and got 88%.
- Started the _Piano Keys_ project.

### Thoughts

- These functions for events are tricky. I don't feel like I have a firm grasp on this yet, so I'll have to make sure I practice this more.
  - Sometimes you need to define what you want something change to inside of parenthesis, and thers after the equal sign. Still not sure what differentiates the two.

## Day 42: May 16, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished video I started yesterday. It was basically a review for the module I completed.
- Started going over event handlers and their uses.
- Couple of examples of built in JS functions in this module are...
  - .onclick
  - .target

### Thoughts

- Not sure if I'm just tired, but the instructions for each exercise don't really seem clear on what they actually want you to do. Once I decifer what they want, then I generally get the syntax right.

- Finished going through exercises and articles about the DOM and manipulating it.
- Took the quiz at the end and got a 93%.
- Started video that review how it all ties together and how to attach the JS file to your html.

### Thoughts

- I'm so tempted to start adding the JS to my portfolio! But I'm sticking to my guns on this. _NO_ portfolio work until _AFTER_ I finish the react sections.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished the video I started yesterday. It did a good job reminding me the difference between the DOM and HTML. It also did a good job explaining parent/child relationships within a tree data structure.
- Did some exercises and walkthroughs on changing and adding DOM elements, both in HTML and CSS.

### Thoughts

- Another day of feeling stupid. My neck is killing me from Jiu Jitsu. I didn't have time to do a full hour before I taught class today. So I had to split my hour in half. Got it done though. Time for a nap.
- I may look up simple retro games in JavaScript. I have an ideaq for my portfolio.

## Day 39: May 13, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Took me around 8 or so tries, but I eventually got 100% on the JavaScript II Sytax quiz. It went over methods like _.ForEach() .map() .filter()_ etc... It's been a minute since I did that, so I was super rusty.
- There was a lot of stuff that I already did for JavaScript II so I got to skip around to the new and Front-End exclusive stuff that I hadn't done in the last course.
- Started a video that intruduced and explained what the DOM is. It's review since I've already done stuff with Dom manipulation, but not enough to say that I can do it all.

### Thoughts

- I don't know if it was because I trained last night and was tired because of it. But it felt like I was extra stupid today. I kept getting the same questions wrong in the quiz. I need to get around to doing more code challenges.

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished Responsive Club Project.
- Read through articles that are new to the JavaScript I and JavaScript II modules.
- Started JavaScript II module quiz. It was part of the new/incompleted items on the JS II module.

### Thoughts

- Finally back to JavaScript!
- I feel kinda bad using an old project as a template for the Responsive club project, but I really needed to get passed the HTML CSS stuff. Yesterday a colleague told me that the dev interview will most likely include grilling me on data structures & algorithms. So it reiterated the fact that I need to get back to the programming parts.
- The JS II quiz made me realize I'm super rusty now. I'll get it back though.

- Started Responsive Club Project.

### Thoughts

- Once I compoleted the UI section, I got to skip ahead to the end of the _Make Websites Responsive Section_, because I already completed it in the Full-Stack Course. I'm using my company flexbox project website as a starter template. It pretty much already has the elements needed to finish this project. Media queries, size declarations written in rems, and the bonus of being mobile first.

## Day 36: May 10, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished Reel Good Review project.

### Thoughts

- In some of these projects, the instructions aren't as clear as I'd like them to be.
  - For example, the Reel Good Review project asked me to make all the headers of the page stand out. That's fine and all, but the headers of the page aren't really well defined. If this were a client or a job, I'd asked their content people, "What text on this page are headers?"
- Also Codecademy site crashed 5 minutes before my hour was up. That's the first time this happened, hopefully it's doesn't keep happening.

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Learned more about text design.
  - Got 100% on the quiz on the first try.
- Started Reel Good Review project.
  - Mostly a review project on the text design principles and concepts we just learned.

### Thoughts

- Text design seems to review most of the stuff I already learned during my copywriting days. I like how concepts taken from other arts & disciplines are applicable to dev.

## Day 34: May 8, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Started & finished the _Pinpoint E-Commerce_ site project.
  - Not much to this project. They basically just give you some tasks to make the UX of the site better.
  - Looks like it's meant to be a review for the UI color concepts and principles I learned in this section.
  - Fairly easy and straight forward.
- Started learning about text design.

### Thoughts

- Today is Mother's Day. It's the first Mother's Day since my mom passed away last November. I didn't feel like coding at all. I just wanted to lay in bed and shut all goals and responsibilities out. But I didn't. Discipline = Freedom!

## Day 33: May 7, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Front-End Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Journey Around The World Project_
- Started going over articles and practice exercises for UI colors.
  - Contrast Contstraints
  - What and how to handle Brand Colors.
  - Accent Colors
  - Styling primary, secondary, etc buttons
  - Styling alert and warnings to keep users aware of them.
  - Effective use of whitespace.
  - Accessibility
  - Etc...

### Thoughts

- Some of the stuff like having high contrast between background and font color seems common sense. Other stuff like whitespace usage and different categories of buttons make me want to change things in my portfolio right now! lol

  - Did some exercises.
  - Got 80% on the quiz, which is good enough for me not to retake it.
  - Started _Journey Around The World Project_

### Thoughts

- I don't want to affirm that I'm bad at art. But boy it sure feels like it. It's hard for me to get colors that go well together, but I'm learning.
- I just want to get past all this design stuff and get back to the engineering parts.

## Day 31: May 5, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox_.
  - Posted final project on Codecademy's forums. But if you all want to see it, the github link is still below.
- Started going through the Front-End Engineer course to read articles, do exercises, and watch videos to make sure I fill any gaps to complete previous modules.
  - Did some exercises that illustrate hue and talks about warm and cool colors.

### Thoughts

- I'm switching back to the front-end course.
  - The reason being, I need to finish a course to get into a developer career quickly. Recent events have greatly increased the urgency for me.
  - The benefit is that all the lessons I've done in the full stack course are transferrable to the front-end course.
  - So instead of being 22% done in my current course, I'm now 31% done.
  - I fully intend on going back and finishing the full stack course after I'm done with front end. I want to know it all and be the best developer I can be. (I'll probably learn Python first, because I have a _real money making_ project in mind. And I need to know Python to pull it off.) This isn't just for a career change. I want to master this discipline!

  - Tried to incorporate _flex-grow_ and _flex-basis_ properties but didn't like the result.

### Thoughts

- For the _advance_ technique so far, I'm just making myself as the main instructor bigger than the rest. (Ego much... Lol!)
- I'll try to use _flex-grow_ with the bottom and top nav areas.

  - Filled out content for both programs area and instructors area of the fictional business site.
  - Added some stylings for the cards of each out those sections to better show the flexbox concepts to be demonstrated.

### Thoughts

- I'm surprised how much time I take to find pictures for made up content. It's much easer if the content is just given to me. That's probably more likely to happen in a work situation.
- I hope you notice the filler text I'm using. Lol!
  - 10 points if you can guess who's quotes they are.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Studied the solution to the Fotomatic project.
- Started _Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox_.
  - Created repo on Github.
  - Started added normal boiler plate stuff to html.
  - Picked out picture for banner.

### Thoughts

- Not to toot my own horn, but in my version of the _Fotomatic_ project, I used waaay less media queries than the solution code to achieve the same result. I feel really great about it! Simpler code is more elegant in my opinion.
- Immediately after that project is what seems like to me will be another long project. But I think this one will be more fun than the last because I get to do most of my own stuff.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Continued on with the Fotomatic project.
  - Adjusted padding for filter section.
  - Adjusted padding, flex, and citation image for quotes section.
  - Adjusted some fonts and padding for smallest media query.

### Thoughts

- Pretty sure I'm done with the project! That was tougher than I expected it to be.
- What's cool is that by the time I got to the mobile version almost every style change was done. Using rem and percents really streamline the process of making things responsive.
- Before I move on, I'm going to examine the solution to see how the _Pro_ handled it. Maybe I can pick up some tricks.

## Day 23: April 27, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Continued on with the Fotomatic project.
  - No matter the changes I made, I couldn't get display: none to work on the .email class on the tablet media query. Found out it was a browser issue. Didn't work on chrome, but it worked fine on Firefox.
  - Update the padding, flex, and alignment in features section to look like specs.
  - Started adjusting elements in the quotes section.

### Thoughts

- Time just flew by this session!

## Day 22: April 26, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Continued on with the Fotomatic project.
  - Feature content's bottom margin was too small, so I fixed that..
  - Made the images container on the filters section a flex box.
  - There was a typo on the quote declaration. Fixed that.
  - Fixed padding in the quotes section.
  - Removed media query for max-width: 890px on line 252. Seems unneccessary, but I may bring it back.

### Thoughts

- Didn't feel well yesterday or today. Still got it done though!

## Day 21: April 25, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Continued on with the Fotomatic project.
  - Fixed header and banner section. They both now look like the spec sheet for desktop.
  - Started fixing the features section.
  - Noticed the container issue came back.
  - Found that the pics were too large in that section. Once I adjusted their width to be 100% of their container, it got fixed.
  - Fixed padding and margins around that section's content too.

### Thoughts

- Fixing the fotomatic desktop section is now flowing like water. I seem to have overcomplicated things with my two initial approaches. But we'll see.
- As soon as I wrote the above sentence, the same issue I ran into before came back. It was the images inside the features all along. They were too big. It way too long to figure that out.

## Day 20: April 24, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Continued on with the Fotomatic project.
  - Started a new branch to try mobile first approach.
  - Scrapped all the media queries in the new branch.
  - Started pulling over css declarations which (I think) are mobile first.
  - Switched back to original branch.
  - Reset original branch to initial commit to use it as a _desktop first_ version.
  - Moved a bunch of css around in the main branch.

### Thoughts

- All night last night, I was thinking a mobile first approach was going to be simpler. And it probably would have, but found that mobile first is only simpler if you're starting from scratch. Not debugging someone else's code. Lesson learned.
- I also realized that the css code is structured in such a way that the declarations were mostly valid. So it seems like they structured the project in a way that you mostly just have to move stuff around. ...maybe.
- Based on this hunch I switched back, I decided to reset to the beginning via git. (Thank god for git! lol!)
- At first I felt like I'm wasting so much time. Until I remembered, the object isn't about getting it done. The object is to learn, understand, and eventually master this stuff. So I'm doing exactly what I need to be doing.

## Day 19: April 23, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Continued on with the Fotomatic project.
  - Got nav padding, height, and margins for desktop looking right. The logo section itself still looks smaller than spec, but I'll come back to that.
  - Got the sign up section positioned according to spec on the desktop version.
  - Added backgound image to the banner/hero section.
  - Add z-index of 8 to keep nav bar on top during scrolling.

### Thoughts

- Having a real tough time figuring out how to get the .main-content section to stretch throughout the whole page on wide screens. Not sure what's keeping it contained and pushed to the left.

## Day 18: April 22, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Reviewed article on using Chrome dev tools to simulate different devices.
  - Took and passed quiz questions.
- Completed Tsunami Coffee exercises.
  - The exercises focused on making an imaginary coffee store's website responsive to different screensizes.
- Review documentation and research on css.
- Started _Fotomatic_ off platform project.
  - Downloaded files and created github repo.

### Thoughts

- The documentation and research section concept is super familiar to me. Working in IT for almost my entire adult life has taught me how valuable it is to be good at internet research - Google, Stack Overflow, MDN, Support Knowledgebases for purchased hardware and software, etc... This is every day life for me.

## Day 17: April 21, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Reviewed relative sizing concepts in css.
  - rems & ems
  - percentages
  - min-width, max-with, min-height, max-height
- Took quiz on above concepts. First run got 75%. Second run 100%.
- Reviewed media queries in css.

### Thoughts

- Relative sizing is review for me. I think I only got some things wrong on the quiz because I was groggy this morning. (Give me a break! Lol! I trained Jiu Jitsu last night. I never sleep well those nights.)
- I thought media queries was going to be review, but there were suprisingly new concepts introduced. I've never worked with dpi or orientation, or used commas in media queries. What's also interesting is Codecademy's methodology of deciding "breakpoints" rather than just flat out designing mobile first. I like it!

## Day 16: April 20, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished quiz on advanced grid concepts. Got an 84% on it. Good enough to move on.
- Completed PupSpa grid practice exercises.
- Completed Task board grid practice exercises.

### Thoughts

- I'm switching to focus soley on Codecademy until I fininsh the react portion of the course. I'm at the point where, if I had 6 good projects to showcase, I'd feel comfortable sharing it now. So working on my portfolio for half the time would give me diminishing returns. The projects I want to build will require heavier lifting in terms of JavaScript and React framework knowledge, so I think it's a better choice for now.

## Day 15: April 19, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Add ease in transition to h1.
- Picked 3 more projects to showcase.
  - Added appropriate screenshots to portfolio cards.
  - Updated h3 of cards to match.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished exercises for grid overlap section.
- Finished exercises that introduces _justify-items_ in gird containers.
- Finished exercises that introduces _justify-content_ in gird containers.
- Finished exercises that introduces _align-items_ in gird containers.
- Finished exercises that introduces _align-content_ in gird containers.
- Finished exercises that introduces _align-self_ & _justify-self_ in gird items.
- Read through section that talks about _implicit grids_ vs _explicit grids_.
- Finished exercises that introduces _grid-auto-rows_ & _grid-auto-columns_ in gird containers.
- Finished exercises that introduces _grid-auto-flow_ in gird containers.

### Thoughts

- I'll need to come up with 2 additional projects to showcase. I have a few others, but I don't think they're good enough to be on my portfolio.
- Went through a lot of grid concepts in rapid succession in Codecademny. Crossing my fingers the info sticks!

## Day 14: April 18, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Styled article buttons for small screens.
  - Made buttons look like nav buttons up top.
  - Added buttons to the rest of the articles.
  - Added ease transtions to the buttons to give a smoother feel.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Took quiz on Grid Essentials. Got an 84%. (Good enough.)
- Did excercises on Grid Template Areas.
- Started section exercises on overlapping grid areas.

### Thoughts

- The small screen layout for my portfolio look more coherent now that the buttons in the article sections are similar.
- Some parts of grid are still confusing. Like when to end _grid-column-end_ and _grid-row-end_... I need to reviw those.

## Day 13: April 17, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Styled article buttons.
  - Nav buttons to either take you to the live site, or take you to the github repo.
  - Made buttons behave like the blog button in the nav.
  - Started testing different button behaviors and color schemes.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Went over using _span_ for grid items. Did some exercises for illustration purposes. I'll need to remember that these need to be set on the items themselves, rather than the container.
- Went over _grid-area_ shorthand. Did more exercises for illustration purposes. I get mixed up between normal and span declarations for setting where the grid stops.
- Did exercises for reviewing all the grid concepts.

### Thoughts

- I should have styled the buttons for small screens similar to how my nav buttons work. Will work on that tomorrow.
- Grid seems like it'll be less responsive than flexbox, when designing mobile first.

## Day 12: April 16, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Looked through old projects to see which one to showcase first.
- Found the one I want and started editing placeholder content.
- Started building buttons on the first article section in the portfolio.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Went over setting grid rows and comlumns.
  - The shortcut to defining them.
  - The _repeat()_ function.
  - The _minmax()_ function.
- Setting spacing between grid items with Grid Gap.
  - using _row-gap_.
  - using _column-gap_.
  - using the shorthand _gap_
- Designing layouts with _grid-row-start_ & _grid-row-end_ and the shorthand _grid-row_.

### Thoughts

- Finally getting real projects up. It's a little intimidating. Not sure what to write about them yet, so I'll probably leave the dummy text on for a good while.
  - Also a little daunting because I'm sure there's a lot of refactoring to do.
- I'm not familiar with any of these types of declarations. Crazy how I didn't go over them in the Treehouse course. This is just as useful as flexbox.

## Day 11: April 15, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Troubleshot why background video wasn't showing up. Found out the file was broken and it wasn't my css or html that was messed up.
- Changed the video and it showed up on the page immediately.
- Updated z-index on css to put it as the bottom layer.
- Updated background of the main section so content in there isn't obscured.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Completed Tea Cozy Project:

  - Created and styled the contact section.
  - Created and styled the footer to spec.

- Started Grid Essentials section

### Thoughts

- The background video is perfect! Couldn't be happier with the result. Too bad I can't upload the video to github because of the size. Wish you guys could see it!
- For the tea cozy project's contact section: The specs didn't specify hover state. But I thought it'd be good design to add underline text decoration on hover state to links. If this were a real client project, I'd have asked the client for an opinion.
- Grid is review. I remember from the previous course they introduced Grid before Flexbox. I thought flexbox was a much easier way to do the same things for responsive websites. This time it's the other way around. And they way their introducing it, they're talking about how grid can handle multidimentional layouts, whereas flexbox is more for flat 2D designs. Interesting...

## Day 10: April 14, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on background video.
  - Put all content into a wrapper called _bg-overlay_
  - Attempt to put video into html and position as background in css. Video isn't showing up. Also margins at top and bottom are kinda messedup now.
  - Background video was too large to push to github. Took a while to figure out how to _un-commit_ the video file.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Put more time into Tea Cozy Project.
  - Added h2 and address cards to section.
  - Styled background of address cards.
  - Aligned items to spec, using flexbox.

### Thoughts

- I know, I know. I said I'd start adding to the portfolio section. But I saw an example of this yesterday and it really blew me away. So I think it'll be an eye catcher for hiring managers and recruiters. So it'll be worth the investment.
- For the tea cozy project. The mockup image looks a little different as far as sizing. But upon inspection all looks right.
- Worked way more than an hour on this #100DaysOfCode session. The large file size issue that was prventing me from pushing the commits up to github took a long time to figure out. Almost lost all of today's portfolio progress.

## Day 9: April 13, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Styled the bottom nav.
  - Made some links disappear on small screens.
  - Made one disappear on large screens.
  - flexed the container on small screens.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Finished the Featured Teas section.
  - Adjusted justify content, spacing, and sizing to spec.

### Thoughts

- Main layout and style of portfolio is pretty close to how I want it. Next step now is to start populating the portfolio section with _"Real actuol work..." -Peter, Office Space_
- The Tea Cozy project is coming along like clockwork. I feel like I'm getting a better grasp of flex as well as what parent containers should be when making them flex boxes or any type of container, really.

## Day 8: April 12, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on organizing the css. It was a mess.
- My header got messed up when I reorganized it.
  - Didn't realize I put some of the declarations for a media query outside of the media query.
  - Started editing CSS to fix. Messed things up even more.
  - Finally found out what it was and was able to fix it.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Finished the Mission Section. Now it looks like how it should in the specs.
  - Changed some classes to IDs for navigation.
  - Added content to the next seation, Featured Teas.
  - Made section a flex box container.

### Thoughts

- I don't agree with not working on courses during this challenge. If you don't know an entire concept, it may be too big for you to tackle without any hints or directions where to go. I know you can do course work outside of the challenge, but some of us are very pressed for time. I have a (more than) full time job. I'm committed to teach Jiu Jitsu, so I have to be at class at least 2x per week. I have kids with needs that need to be met. So I'd like to propose that it's OK to do coursework along side a particular project, as long as the course is specifically helping you with said project.
- Not sure making the section a flex container is a good move. It contains the h2 and h4 heading. That should be 100% the width of the parent container in the spec. But I may be able to use flex-grow to make it stretch.

## Day 7: April 11, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on the top and bottom nav for large screens.
  -Alignment was off. There were also borders areound li elements that I didn't want there.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  -Nav now looks like how it does in the specs.
  -Main section content and background is added. Layout is still kinda messed up.

### Thoughts

- I feel like the whole "mobile first" approach to my portfolio is making the css for the nav more difficult than it should be.
  - Maybe I'll work on reorganizing my css tomorrow. ...maybe.
- The tea cozy is coming along nicely. Not sure if flexbox is appropriate for this section, but this project is part of the flex section, so I guess I should try using it.
- Today is my wife's birthday! Yet I'm alone in my home office working on this stuff, but I'm done for the day. I'll be a good husband and hang out with her.

## Day 6: April 10, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on the top nav for small screens. My changing the last li to a button messed things up for the mobile size.
  - Buttons look better now. Matches the them a bit more.
  - However the new li borders now appear on the larger screens.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Set main body colors and font stylings according to required specs in the css file.
  - Create nav.
  - Set display flex for nav's ul.
  - Aligned items and sized logo to spec.

### Thoughts

- Building the nav to spec from scratch is so much easier than retrofitting it into an old project. I'm thinking I should just scrap my portfoloio and rebuild the whole thing from scratch. Or maybe spend the time to clean up the css. It's so unorganized now. So much trash.

## Day 5: April 9, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked more on the nav for wide-screens.
  -Made it so the blog is different from the rest of the in-page links. Now it's a button.
  -Adjusted the bottom border of the nav to give it an underline feel.
- Tried to fix color and buttons for small screens but couldn't get it right in time.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Flexbox: To-Do App_ project.
- Started Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Created README.md and boilerplate html and css, so you can see the specs for this project.

### Thoughts

- Working through CSS on Codecademy and on my portfolio shows me that there are still a good amount of things I struggle on for front end development. An example is, I'm still unsure what the difference is between inline flex and flex containers. I just go `display: flex` on every contnainer I want as a flex container and it seems to work... until it doesn't. lol
- I should've been making README.md files for every project I make. They do a good job of illustrating what the project is trying to accomplish.

## Day 4: April 8, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Added the nav in the footer back.
  - It styled the same as the top nav for smaller screens. Had to figure out how to restructure my CSS to fix that.
- Flexboxed the footer nav.
- Changed the border color for the main section to a softer one.
- The colors and fonts were changed. But I did that yesterday afternoon/night, so that doesn't count towards the challenge.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Completed the exercises for nested flexboxes.
- Completed review exersises for flex concepts.
- Took the quiz on flex. I was able to get 100% on the 3rd try.

### Thoughts

- Forgot to push my finished log file yesterday. But if you look at the my commits, you'll see that they were made yesterday, so I didn't fail the challenge. lol
- I'm thinking, I can use flex-basis for my initials in my nav. I want to push it to the right of the screen, but I haven't found an elegant way to do it yet.
- I'll have to review flex at a later point. Seems I still don't have a full grasp on it yet. Not sure if it's just because I'm tired, but I got a lot of things wrong on the first couple tries of the quiz.

## Day 3: April 7, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Deleted a bunch more stuff from html.
- Carefully picked through the messy land mine of my poorly structured CSS file.
- Created sections to how I do them now.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished up exercises on flex-wrap. Already thinking about how I'll use it in my portfolio.
- Finished exercises on align-content.
- Finished exercises on flex-direction.
- Finished exercises on flex-flow shortcut.

### Thoughts

- This morning was a little disasterous. Not only was I super tired from not enough sleep (Jiu Jitsu always gives me insomnia.). The hard drive that houses my repo crashed. I was able to repair it (Thank god for git!!), but lost a lot of time. I was still able to work on what I needed. One thing I have full confidence in, is my ability to power through adversity.
- Flex seems so much easier to manage and manipulate layout than just using grid. But I remember asking more experienced developers about why they'd ever chose grid properties over flex, and they did say that some scenarios grid is more appropriate. I can't see it, but I'm sure I'll end up agreeing at some point. Said the same thing about many Jiu Jitsu techniques.
- It'll be another training night tonight. I'm half considering not training, but then I'd be sacrificing my kids training too. I shouldn't let my goals get in the way of my responsibilities as a father.

## Day 2: April 6, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Got rid of dated looking header/hero section.
- Started fixing nav to use flex-box instead of grid properties.
  - Removed classess.
  - Moved around sections within ul.
  - add a div
  - got rid if div

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Got familiar with flex-grow & flex-shrink with tutorial and exercises. Don't remember ever going over that in the Treehouse course.
- Went over flex-basis combinations with the above properties. Did exercises to demo their effects on divs. I vaguely remember flex-basis from my other courses.
- Learned shorthand to combine all three properties. (Example: Flex: 1 5 50px)
- Started section exercises for flex-wrap.

### Thoughts

- There's a lot of "untangling" to do with the CSS in the template I chose as a portfolio. Wanted to just dump the whole thing several times. lol!
- I looked up examples of some of the best developer portfolios yesterday. They were very inspiring and discouraging at the same time. I have a long way to go. But I've been here before with many things I now do very well. So it's just another thing...
- I'm training Jiu Jitsu tonight. So I'll be insanely tired tomorrow morning. It'll be my first real test to this commitment.

## Day 1: April 5, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Remove hover states in nav.
- Change background-color to new color scheme.
- Change main section background-color to new color scheme.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Started reviewing responsive web design.
- First part explained the grid. Haven't touched CSS in a good while. So I need it. Took a quiz after and got 100% on the first try.
- Second part is flexbox. Now this one is definitely a need!

### Thoughts

- Two main things I'm focusing on for the next 100 days are my developer portfolio. And the Codecademy full stack developer course.
- I believe if I'm going to break into this industry, these two things are paramount.
- I'm using an old project as a template for my portfolio.
  - The project didn't even use Flexbox, so I have a lot of CSS work ahead of me. Haven't touched CSS as much in months. Maybe a solid year since I did any grid or flex work. But I'm up to the task, of course.
- I know technically you're not supposed to be working on courses or tutorials for this challenge unless your brand-new to coding. While, I'm technically _not_ brand-new, but I've never actually completed a full course. I've started with the very expensive Team Treehouse tech degreee, but COVID hit and no longer could afford it. Then I switched to Codecademy and found that the course was better at a fraction of the course. Then ended up dropping that a few months in... If you follow me on social media, you've most likely seen that I've been hit with back to back tragedies. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'd like to get a full course completed, so I'm not making things harder on myself by not knowing or understanding fundamentals. (Fundamentals are important! This is 14 years of Jiu Jitsu talking. There are a lot of similarities between the two disciplines.)
