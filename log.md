# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 5 2022, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Remove hover states in nav.
- Change background-color to new color scheme.
- Change main section background-color to new color scheme.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Started reviewing responsive web design.
- First part explained the grid. Haven't touched CSS in a good while. So I need it. Took a quiz after and got 100% on the first try.
- Second part is flexbox. Now this one is definitely a need!

**Thoughts**:

- Two main things I'm focusing on for the next 100 days are my developer portfolio. And the Codecademy full stack developer course.
- I believe if I'm going to break into this industry, these two things are paramount.
- I'm using an old project as a template for my portfolio.
  - The project didn't even use Flexbox, so I have a lot of CSS work ahead of me. Haven't touched CSS as much in months. Maybe a solid year since I did any grid or flex work. But I'm up to the task, of course.
- I know technically you're not supposed to be working on courses or tutorials for this challenge unless your brand-new to coding. While, I'm technically _not_ brand-new, but I've never actually completed a full course. I've started with the very expensive Team Treehouse tech degreee, but COVID hit and no longer could afford it. Then I switched to Codecademy and found that the course was better at a fraction of the course. Then ended up dropping that a few months in... If you follow me on social media, you've most likely seen that I've been hit with back to back tragedies. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'd like to get a full course completed, so I'm not making things harder on myself by not knowing or understanding fundamentals. (Fundamentals are important! This is 14 years of Jiu Jitsu talking. There are a lot of similarities between the two disciplines.)
