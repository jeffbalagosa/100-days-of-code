# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 10: April 14, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on background video.
  - Put all content into a wrapper called _bg-overlay_
  - Attempt to put video into html and position as background in css. Video isn't showing up. Also margins at top and bottom are kinda messedup now.
  - Background video was too large to push to github. Took a while to figure out how to _un-commit_ the video file.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Put more time into Tea Cozy Project.
  - Added h2 and address cards to section.
  - Styled background of address cards.
  - Aligned items to spec, using flexbox.

### Thoughts

- I know, I know. I said I'd start adding to the portfolio section. But I saw an example of this yesterday and it really blew me away. So I think it'll be an eye catcher for hiring managers and recruiters. So it'll be worth the investment.
- For the tea cozy project. The mockup image looks a little different as far as sizing. But upon inspection all looks right.
- Worked way more than an hour on this #100DaysOfCode session. The large file size issue that was prventing me from pushing the commits up to github took a long time to figure out. Almost lost all of today's portfolio progress.

## Day 9: April 13, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Styled the bottom nav.
  - Made some links disappear on small screens.
  - Made one disappear on large screens.
  - flexed the container on small screens.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Finished the Featured Teas section.
  - Adjusted justify content, spacing, and sizing to spec.

### Thoughts

- Main layout and style of portfolio is pretty close to how I want it. Next step now is to start populating the portfolio section with _"Real actuol work..." -Peter, Office Space_
- The Tea Cozy project is coming along like clockwork. I feel like I'm getting a better grasp of flex as well as what parent containers should be when making them flex boxes or any type of container, really.

## Day 8: April 12, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on organizing the css. It was a mess.
- My header got messed up when I reorganized it.
  - Didn't realize I put some of the declarations for a media query outside of the media query.
  - Started editing CSS to fix. Messed things up even more.
  - Finally found out what it was and was able to fix it.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Finished the Mission Section. Now it looks like how it should in the specs.
  - Changed some classes to IDs for navigation.
  - Added content to the next seation, Featured Teas.
  - Made section a flex box container.

### Thoughts

- I don't agree with not working on courses during this challenge. If you don't know an entire concept, it may be too big for you to tackle without any hints or directions where to go. I know you can do course work outside of the challenge, but some of us are very pressed for time. I have a (more than) full time job. I'm committed to teach Jiu Jitsu, so I have to be at class at least 2x per week. I have kids with needs that need to be met. So I'd like to propose that it's OK to do coursework along side a particular project, as long as the course is specifically helping you with said project.
- Not sure making the section a flex container is a good move. It contains the h2 and h4 heading. That should be 100% the width of the parent container in the spec. But I may be able to use flex-grow to make it stretch.

## Day 7: April 11, 2022, Monday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on the top and bottom nav for large screens.
  -Alignment was off. There were also borders areound li elements that I didn't want there.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  -Nav now looks like how it does in the specs.
  -Main section content and background is added. Layout is still kinda messed up.

### Thoughts

- I feel like the whole "mobile first" approach to my portfolio is making the css for the nav more difficult than it should be.
  - Maybe I'll work on reorganizing my css tomorrow. ...maybe.
- The tea cozy is coming along nicely. Not sure if flexbox is appropriate for this section, but this project is part of the flex section, so I guess I should try using it.
- Today is my wife's birthday! Yet I'm alone in my home office working on this stuff, but I'm done for the day. I'll be a good husband and hang out with her.

## Day 6: April 10, 2022, Sunday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked on the top nav for small screens. My changing the last li to a button messed things up for the mobile size.
  - Buttons look better now. Matches the them a bit more.
  - However the new li borders now appear on the larger screens.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Worked on Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Set main body colors and font stylings according to required specs in the css file.
  - Create nav.
  - Set display flex for nav's ul.
  - Aligned items and sized logo to spec.

### Thoughts

- Building the nav to spec from scratch is so much easier than retrofitting it into an old project. I'm thinking I should just scrap my portfoloio and rebuild the whole thing from scratch. Or maybe spend the time to clean up the css. It's so unorganized now. So much trash.

## Day 5: April 9, 2022, Saturday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Worked more on the nav for wide-screens.
  -Made it so the blog is different from the rest of the in-page links. Now it's a button.
  -Adjusted the bottom border of the nav to give it an underline feel.
- Tried to fix color and buttons for small screens but couldn't get it right in time.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished _Flexbox: To-Do App_ project.
- Started Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.
  - Created README.md and boilerplate html and css, so you can see the specs for this project.

### Thoughts

- Working through CSS on Codecademy and on my portfolio shows me that there are still a good amount of things I struggle on for front end development. An example is, I'm still unsure what the difference is between inline flex and flex containers. I just go `display: flex` on every contnainer I want as a flex container and it seems to work... until it doesn't. lol
- I should've been making README.md files for every project I make. They do a good job of illustrating what the project is trying to accomplish.

## Day 4: April 8, 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Added the nav in the footer back.
  - It styled the same as the top nav for smaller screens. Had to figure out how to restructure my CSS to fix that.
- Flexboxed the footer nav.
- Changed the border color for the main section to a softer one.
- The colors and fonts were changed. But I did that yesterday afternoon/night, so that doesn't count towards the challenge.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Completed the exercises for nested flexboxes.
- Completed review exersises for flex concepts.
- Took the quiz on flex. I was able to get 100% on the 3rd try.

### Thoughts

- Forgot to push my finished log file yesterday. But if you look at the my commits, you'll see that they were made yesterday, so I didn't fail the challenge. lol
- I'm thinking, I can use flex-basis for my initials in my nav. I want to push it to the right of the screen, but I haven't found an elegant way to do it yet.
- I'll have to review flex at a later point. Seems I still don't have a full grasp on it yet. Not sure if it's just because I'm tired, but I got a lot of things wrong on the first couple tries of the quiz.

## Day 3: April 7, 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Deleted a bunch more stuff from html.
- Carefully picked through the messy land mine of my poorly structured CSS file.
- Created sections to how I do them now.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished up exercises on flex-wrap. Already thinking about how I'll use it in my portfolio.
- Finished exercises on align-content.
- Finished exercises on flex-direction.
- Finished exercises on flex-flow shortcut.

### Thoughts

- This morning was a little disasterous. Not only was I super tired from not enough sleep (Jiu Jitsu always gives me insomnia.). The hard drive that houses my repo crashed. I was able to repair it (Thank god for git!!), but lost a lot of time. I was still able to work on what I needed. One thing I have full confidence in, is my ability to power through adversity.
- Flex seems so much easier to manage and manipulate layout than just using grid. But I remember asking more experienced developers about why they'd ever chose grid properties over flex, and they did say that some scenarios grid is more appropriate. I can't see it, but I'm sure I'll end up agreeing at some point. Said the same thing about many Jiu Jitsu techniques.
- It'll be another training night tonight. I'm half considering not training, but then I'd be sacrificing my kids training too. I shouldn't let my goals get in the way of my responsibilities as a father.

## Day 2: April 6, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Got rid of dated looking header/hero section.
- Started fixing nav to use flex-box instead of grid properties.
  - Removed classess.
  - Moved around sections within ul.
  - add a div
  - got rid if div

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Got familiar with flex-grow & flex-shrink with tutorial and exercises. Don't remember ever going over that in the Treehouse course.
- Went over flex-basis combinations with the above properties. Did exercises to demo their effects on divs. I vaguely remember flex-basis from my other courses.
- Learned shorthand to combine all three properties. (Example: Flex: 1 5 50px)
- Started section exercises for flex-wrap.

### Thoughts

- There's a lot of "untangling" to do with the CSS in the template I chose as a portfolio. Wanted to just dump the whole thing several times. lol!
- I looked up examples of some of the best developer portfolios yesterday. They were very inspiring and discouraging at the same time. I have a long way to go. But I've been here before with many things I now do very well. So it's just another thing...
- I'm training Jiu Jitsu tonight. So I'll be insanely tired tomorrow morning. It'll be my first real test to this commitment.

## Day 1: April 5, 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Remove hover states in nav.
- Change background-color to new color scheme.
- Change main section background-color to new color scheme.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Started reviewing responsive web design.
- First part explained the grid. Haven't touched CSS in a good while. So I need it. Took a quiz after and got 100% on the first try.
- Second part is flexbox. Now this one is definitely a need!

### Thoughts

- Two main things I'm focusing on for the next 100 days are my developer portfolio. And the Codecademy full stack developer course.
- I believe if I'm going to break into this industry, these two things are paramount.
- I'm using an old project as a template for my portfolio.
  - The project didn't even use Flexbox, so I have a lot of CSS work ahead of me. Haven't touched CSS as much in months. Maybe a solid year since I did any grid or flex work. But I'm up to the task, of course.
- I know technically you're not supposed to be working on courses or tutorials for this challenge unless your brand-new to coding. While, I'm technically _not_ brand-new, but I've never actually completed a full course. I've started with the very expensive Team Treehouse tech degreee, but COVID hit and no longer could afford it. Then I switched to Codecademy and found that the course was better at a fraction of the course. Then ended up dropping that a few months in... If you follow me on social media, you've most likely seen that I've been hit with back to back tragedies. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'd like to get a full course completed, so I'm not making things harder on myself by not knowing or understanding fundamentals. (Fundamentals are important! This is 14 years of Jiu Jitsu talking. There are a lot of similarities between the two disciplines.)
