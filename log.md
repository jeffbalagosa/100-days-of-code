# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 5 2022, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Remove hover states in nav.
- Change background-color to new color scheme.
- Change main section background-color to new color scheme.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Started reviewing responsive web design.
- First part explained the grid. Haven't touched CSS in a good while. So I need it. Took a quiz after and got 100% on the first try.
- Second part is flexbox. Now this one is definitely a need!

**Thoughts**

- I know technically you're not supposed to be working on courses for this challenge unless your brand-new to coding. I'm technically not brand-new, but I've never actually completed a full course before.
