# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 4: April 8 2022, Friday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Added the nav in the footer back.
  - It styled the same as the top nav for smaller screens. Had to figure out how to restructure my CSS to fix that.
- Flexboxed the footer nav.
- Changed the border color for the main section to a softer one.
- The colors and fonts were changed. But I did that yesterday afternoon/night, so that doesn't count towards the challenge.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Completed the exercises for nested flexboxes.
- Completed review exersises for flex concepts.
- Took the quiz on flex. I was able to get 100% on the 3rd try.

### Thoughts

- Forgot to push my finished log file yesterday. But if you look at the my commits, you'll see that they were made yesterday, so I didn't fail the challenge. lol
- I'm thinking, I can use flex-basis for my initials in my nav. I want to push it to the right of the screen, but I haven't found an elegant way to do it yet.
- I'll have to review flex at a later point. Seems I still don't have a full grasp on it yet. Not sure if it's just because I'm tired, but I got a lot of things wrong on the first couple tries of the quiz.

## Day 3: April 7 2022, Thursday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Deleted a bunch more stuff from html.
- Carefully picked through the messy land mine of my poorly structured CSS file.
- Created sections to how I do them now.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Finished up exercises on flex-wrap. Already thinking about how I'll use it in my portfolio.
- Finished exercises on align-content.
- Finished exercises on flex-direction.
- Finished exercises on flex-flow shortcut.

### Thoughts

- This morning was a little disasterous. Not only was I super tired from not enough sleep (Jiu Jitsu always gives me insomnia.). The hard drive that houses my repo crashed. I was able to repair it (Thank god for git!!), but lost a lot of time. I was still able to work on what I needed. One thing I have full confidence in, is my ability to power through adversity.
- Flex seems so much easier to manage and manipulate layout than just using grid. But I remember asking more experienced developers about why they'd ever chose grid properties over flex, and they did say that some scenarios grid is more appropriate. I can't see it, but I'm sure I'll end up agreeing at some point. Said the same thing about many Jiu Jitsu techniques.
- It'll be another training night tonight. I'm half considering not training, but then I'd be sacrificing my kids training too. I shouldn't let my goals get in the way of my responsibilities as a father.

## Day 2: April 6 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Got rid of dated looking header/hero section.
- Started fixing nav to use flex-box instead of grid properties.
  - Removed classess.
  - Moved around sections within ul.
  - add a div
  - got rid if div

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Got familiar with flex-grow & flex-shrink with tutorial and exercises. Don't remember ever going over that in the Treehouse course.
- Went over flex-basis combinations with the above properties. Did exercises to demo their effects on divs. I vaguely remember flex-basis from my other courses.
- Learned shorthand to combine all three properties. (Example: Flex: 1 5 50px)
- Started section exercises for flex-wrap.

### Thoughts

- There's a lot of "untangling" to do with the CSS in the template I chose as a portfolio. Wanted to just dump the whole thing several times. lol!
- I looked up examples of some of the best developer portfolios yesterday. They were very inspiring and discouraging at the same time. I have a long way to go. But I've been here before with many things I now do very well. So it's just another thing...
- I'm training Jiu Jitsu tonight. So I'll be insanely tired tomorrow morning. It'll be my first real test to this commitment.

## Day 1: April 5 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Remove hover states in nav.
- Change background-color to new color scheme.
- Change main section background-color to new color scheme.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Started reviewing responsive web design.
- First part explained the grid. Haven't touched CSS in a good while. So I need it. Took a quiz after and got 100% on the first try.
- Second part is flexbox. Now this one is definitely a need!

### Thoughts

- Two main things I'm focusing on for the next 100 days are my developer portfolio. And the Codecademy full stack developer course.
- I believe if I'm going to break into this industry, these two things are paramount.
- I'm using an old project as a template for my portfolio.
  - The project didn't even use Flexbox, so I have a lot of CSS work ahead of me. Haven't touched CSS as much in months. Maybe a solid year since I did any grid or flex work. But I'm up to the task, of course.
- I know technically you're not supposed to be working on courses or tutorials for this challenge unless your brand-new to coding. While, I'm technically _not_ brand-new, but I've never actually completed a full course. I've started with the very expensive Team Treehouse tech degreee, but COVID hit and no longer could afford it. Then I switched to Codecademy and found that the course was better at a fraction of the course. Then ended up dropping that a few months in... If you follow me on social media, you've most likely seen that I've been hit with back to back tragedies. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'd like to get a full course completed, so I'm not making things harder on myself by not knowing or understanding fundamentals. (Fundamentals are important! This is 14 years of Jiu Jitsu talking. There are a lot of similarities between the two disciplines.)
