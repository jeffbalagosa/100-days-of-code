# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: April 5 2022, Tuesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Remove hover states in nav.
- Change background-color to new color scheme.
- Change main section background-color to new color scheme.

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Started reviewing responsive web design.
- First part explained the grid. Haven't touched CSS in a good while. So I need it. Took a quiz after and got 100% on the first try.
- Second part is flexbox. Now this one is definitely a need!

### Thoughts

- I know technically you're not supposed to be working on courses for this challenge unless your brand-new to coding. I'm technically not brand-new, but I've never actually completed a full course before.

## Day 1: April 6 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

Worked on my portfolio:

- Got rid of dated looking header/hero section.
- Started fixing nav to use flex-box instead of grid properties.
  - Removed classess.
  - Moved around sections within ul.
  - add a div
  - got rid if div

Worked on Full-Stack Course on Codecademy:

- Got familiar with flex-grow & flex-shrink with tutorial and exercises. Don't remember ever going over that in the Treehouse course.
- Went over flex-basis combinations with the above properties. Did exercises to demo their effects on divs. I vaguely remember flex-basis from my other courses.
- Learned shorthand to combine all three properties. (Example: Flex: 1 5 50px)
- Started section exercises for flex-wrap.

### Thoughts

- There's a lot of "untangling" to do with the CSS in the template I chose as a portfolio. Wanted to just dump the whole thing several times. lol!
- I looked up examples of some of the best developer portfolios yesterday. They were very inspiring and discouraging at the same time. I have a long way to go. But I've been here before with many things I now do very well. So it's just another thing...
- I'm training Jiu Jitsu tonight. So I'll be insanely tired tomorrow morning. It'll be my first real test to this commitment.
